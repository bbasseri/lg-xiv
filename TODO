Liquid Galaxy version:
----------------------
* "When we put a scratched DVD in the player and it glitches, the kids say it's
  "scratching". They say that about the pano viewer, too. I'd like to fix that."
* The initial sizing ought to be better, so that more than just the central
  screen is involved.
* It would be good to have settings that would restrict the navigability with
  respect to the top and bottom.
* Create simple example documentation for running on a galaxy
* Make mouse / spacenav sensitivity a command-line option
* Also make spacenav axes a command-line option (move spnav left, image goes
  left vs. right)
* Make Xwindow class name and instance string command-line options
* Make xiv complain when it gets command line options it doesn't understand.
  Right now it thinks they're image names. Perhaps it's best to complain when
  it gets an image name it can't find a file for.
* Change spacenav buttons to cycle, instead of recentering image. Perhaps
  holding the button for a while should recenter, but it's not so important to
  recenter anymore since we have decent constraints on motion.
* Prevent white borders from showing up with zoom levels, pan amounts
