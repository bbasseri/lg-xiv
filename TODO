Liquid Galaxy version:
----------------------
"When we put a scratched DVD in the player and it glitches, the kids say it's "scratching". They say that about the pano viewer, too. I'd like to fix that."
The initial sizing ought to be better, so that more than just the central screen is involved.
It would be good to have settings that would restrict the navigability with respect to the top and bottom.

Original version:
-----------------
Better read_tiff function (Tile,...).
Better gamma correction.
Add title to kdialog/Xdialog.
Customizable shortcuts.
Improve cache and preload.
Recursive search + skip to next directory.
